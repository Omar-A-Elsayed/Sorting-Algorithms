# Sorting Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of four sorting algorithms in **C++**: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort.

## Algorithms Explaining

1. **Bubble Sort**:

   - A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

2. **Selection Sort**:

   - Another comparison-based sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist and an unsorted sublist. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted sublist and swaps it with the leftmost unsorted element.

3. **Quick Sort**:

   - A highly efficient divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. It picks a pivot element and partitions the array around the pivot, such that elements less than the pivot are on the left and elements greater than the pivot are on the right. It then recursively sorts the subarrays.

4. **Merge Sort**:
   - Another efficient, comparison-based sorting algorithm that divides the array into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves to produce the sorted array.

## Usage

This repository contains implementations of four sorting algorithms in C++: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort. Each algorithm is implemented in its own `.cpp` file.

To use these sorting algorithms, follow these steps:

1. **Choose an Algorithm**:-

   - `bubble sort.cpp` for Bubble Sort
   - `selection sort.cpp` for Selection Sort
   - `quick sort.cpp` for Quick Sort
   - `merge sort.cpp` for Merge Sort

2. **Run the Algorithm**:

   - Open the chosen `.cpp` file in your text editor.
   - compile and run the file.

3. **Input**:

   - You will enter the number of elements (`n`) in the array.
   - After entering `n`, input the elements of the array one by one.

4. **Output**: After sorting, the algorithm will display the sorted array.
